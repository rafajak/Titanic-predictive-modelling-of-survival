## Predicting the Survival of Passengers on Titanic with Machine Learning (Kaggle competition) 

Ahoy! I took up this classic among data science projects to brush up on my skills of data wrangling, visualisation, and classification with "shallow learning" algorithms using sklearn.
Hope you find it useful in one way or another.
If you have any questions about this project, have any suggestions on how to improve it, or if would like to work with me on something - feel free to contact me at rafajak@gmail.com. Cheers!
